# .NET WebAPI Infrastructure Deployment

## Overview

This repository contains infrastructure templates and configurations for deploying a .NET WebAPI and an RDS (Relational Database Service) instance on AWS. The main objective is to provide a scalable, secure, and efficient infrastructure solution that enables seamless deployment and management of .NET WebAPI projects.

## Features

Infrastructure templates for deploying a .NET WebAPI and an RDS instance on AWS.
CI/CD pipeline setup for continuous integration and deployment of the .NET WebAPI.

Security best practices implementation for both the .NET WebAPI and RDS resources.

High availability and redundancy configuration for the WebAPI and RDS.

Monitoring and logging setup for enhanced visibility and traceability.

Auto-scaling strategy implementation for the WebAPI.

Infrastructure as code best practices adherence for modularity, reusability, and version control.

Cost optimization while maintaining performance and scalability of resources.

## Installation

To deploy the infrastructure and set up the .NET WebAPI on AWS, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

AWS Account: You need an AWS account with appropriate permissions to create resources like EC2 instances, RDS instances, IAM roles, etc.

AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine.

.NET Core SDK: Install the .NET Core SDK to build and run the .NET WebAPI locally.

Git: Install Git for version control and cloning this repository.

## Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:

bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/your-username/dotnetapi-infrastructure.git

Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd dotnet-webapi-infra
Deploy Infrastructure:

Choose the preferred technology for infrastructure provisioning (AWS CloudFormation, AWS CDK, or Terraform).
Follow the instructions in the respective README or documentation to deploy the infrastructure.
Build and Deploy the .NET WebAPI:

Navigate to the .NET WebAPI directory.

Build the .NET WebAPI project:

bash
Copy code
dotnet build
Deploy the .NET WebAPI to AWS:

bash
Copy code
dotnet publish -c Release -o out
Upload the published files to an EC2 instance or use AWS Lambda for serverless deployment.

## Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:

Configure following the instructions provided in the CI/CD pipeline documentation.
Connect the pipeline to your repository and set up triggers for automatic deployment upon code changes.

## Configure Security and Monitoring:

Implement security best practices using AWS IAM, AWS KMS, and other relevant services.
Set up monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail for enhanced visibility and traceability.
Optimize Costs:

## Use AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Trusted Advisor to optimize resource costs while maintaining performance and scalability.
Usage
Once the infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline are set up, you can:

## Deploy your .NET WebAPI projects on AWS by pushing changes to the repository.
Monitor the performance and logs of your deployed resources through AWS Management Console or CLI.
Scale your WebAPI dynamically based on predefined metrics and triggers.
