## Overview

This project aims to set up an infrastructure template for deploying a .NET WebAPI and an RDS (Relational Database Service) instance to AWS. The template is designed to ensure extensibility for future changes and includes the creation of a CI/CD pipeline for the WebAPI.

## Infrastructure as Code (IAC)

1. **Infrastructure Templates Creation**: Utilizing AWS CloudFormation, AWS CDK, or Terraform, infrastructure templates are created to:

   - Deploy a scalable .NET WebAPI on AWS, with provisions for future enhancements.
   - Configure an RDS instance with optimal resource capacity, considering scalability and adaptability.
   - Facilitate customization of both the .NET WebAPI and RDS resources for evolving requirements.
   - Establish a CI/CD pipeline for seamless code deployment to the .NET WebAPI using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and related services.

2. **Security Implementation**: Best practices for security are implemented for both the .NET WebAPI and RDS resources, including access controls, encryption, and network security using AWS IAM, AWS KMS, and relevant services.

3. **High Availability and Redundancy**: Measures are taken to ensure high availability and redundancy for the WebAPI and RDS, including a disaster recovery plan through AWS Auto Scaling, AWS RDS Multi-AZ deployments, and AWS Backup.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging are set up for both the WebAPI and RDS using AWS CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail for enhanced visibility and traceability.

5. **Auto-Scaling Strategy**: An auto-scaling strategy for the WebAPI is designed and implemented based on relevant metrics and triggers using AWS Auto Scaling to enhance system resilience and performance.

6. **Infrastructure as Code Best Practices**: Best practices are followed to ensure modularity, reusability, and version control using AWS CloudFormation StackSets, AWS CDK, or Terraform.

7. **Cost Optimization**: Resource costs are optimized while maintaining performance and scalability using insights from AWS Cost Explorer and recommendations from AWS Trusted Advisor.

## Conclusion

This README serves as a guide for setting up a robust infrastructure to deploy .NET WebAPI projects on AWS. By following the outlined steps, users can establish a solid foundation for their cloud-based applications, ensuring efficiency and security in their deployments.
